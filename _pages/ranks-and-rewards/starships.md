## Starships Rewards

The PCs can use the following house rules to own ships and build a fleet as they rank up in the New Order.
They use their Contribution Ranks (CR) as a currency.
PCs can spend CR liberally; for example, PCs want to buy a corvette, PC1 spends 2 CR, PC2 spends 1 CR, while the others spend nothing.

> One variant that we use is to charge 1 CR per player for smaller ships like a Corvette.
> While you can use this, I think that sticking to a fixed cost would make it easier.

**Legend**

-   `ISB Rank` is the name of the rank
-   `Min CR` is the minimum Contribution Rank required to access that type of vessel
-   `Max Sil.` is the max size that can be obtained (based on the Min CR)
-   `Max cost` is the max cost (in credit) that can be obtained (based on the Min CR)
-   `CR Cost` is the number of CR that must be spent to obtain the vessel

## Guidelines (lower ranks)

Due to the fact that Star Wars starships are not logically organized by anything, it was very hard to create a formula to calculate the CR cost of a ship based on its size for credit cost. This is a guideline, but I think that GMs should adjust the cost based on each ship individually.

| ISB Rank             | Min CR | Max Sil. | Max cost    | CR Cost | Examples                        |
| -------------------- | ------ | -------- | ----------- | ------- | ------------------------------- |
| -                    | 1      | 4        | 500,000     | 1       | Light freighter                 |
| Agent                | 6      | 5        | 3,500,000   | 3       | Corvette                        |
| Senior Agent         | 9      | 6        | 7,500,000   | 4       | Carrier                         |
| Lieutenant Commander | 12     | 8        | 50,000,000  | 5       | Victory-Class Star Destroyer    |
| Commander            | 15     | 8        | 150,000,000 | 7       | Imperial I-Class Star Destroyer |
| Colonel              | 19     | 8        | 250,000,000 | 8       | Secutor-class Star Destroyer    |

## Guidelines (higher ranks)

The following higher-level ranks need to be revised, but here is their actual state.

| ISB Rank                 | Min CR | Max Sil. | Max cost      | CR Cost | Examples                                                 |
| ------------------------ | ------ | -------- | ------------- | ------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| Senior Colonel           | 23     | 9        | 500,000,000   | 10      |                                                          |
| -                        | 27     | 9        | 750,000,000   | 14      | Praetor Mark II-class battlecruiser                      |
| -                        | 31     | 9        | 1,000,000,000 | 18      |                                                          |
| Deputy Director/Governor | 35     | 9        | 1,500,000,000 | 20      | Assertor-class Star Dreadnought                          |
| Director/Moff            | 40     | 9        | 2,000,000,000 | 20      | Super Star Destroyer                                     |
| Grand Moff               | 45     | 10       | ∞             | ∞       | Unique project (like building a Death Star or something) |
