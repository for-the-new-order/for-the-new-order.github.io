## General Guidelines

-   5 xp per hour played
-   10-30 xp for an episode completion
-   20-50 xp for a story arc completion

> This is the only XP that new players joining during the campaign gets.

## Presence

-   5 xp per player that attend (per session)

> This account for the player's presence, participation, and his normal-good RP.

## Extra

-   ~~10 xp for exceptional motivation play (once per character's lifetime) - as per the rules~~
-   ~~5 xp for great RP or motivation play (once per episode) - as per the rules~~
-   5 xp for exceptional RP or motivation play (once per episode)
-   5 xp for very original or game-changer idea (once per episode)
-   5 xp for interesting or very useful usage of a story points

> Extra XP for milestone completions and exceptional roleplay.
> This should not be given very often, only on rare occasion.
>
> I don't apply the normal rules (~~stroked~~) because the 5xp is included in the `5 xp per player that attend the game session`.
> Moreover, I don't mind giving an extra 5 xp from time to time for exceptional play; not just once per lifetime for motivation play.

## Using my XP

-   Players can use XP to "level up" characters only between episodes
-   Players can flip a Story Point to invest XP during a game session (at GM discretion)

## Definitions

### Game session

A game session is a game night; usually around 2-3 hours of play time.

### Episode

An episode is an adventure, that can span multiple game sessions.

### Story arc

A Story arc is a story that span multiple episode.

For example:

-   Running after a rebel cell and destroying their base after months of play.
-   Running away from an enemy, and, after multiple episodes, finally trapping him into stopping his pursuit (maybe having him arrested, killing him, etc.).
