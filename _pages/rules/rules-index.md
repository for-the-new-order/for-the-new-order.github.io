Age of Rebellion's duty system (p. 49, 325).

## Skills

-   Use Genesys general skills, but:
    -   `Alchemy` is not used
    -   `Driving` is the same as `Piloting (planetary)`
    -   `Operating` means piloting capital ship
    -   `Piloting` is the same as `Piloting (space)`
    -   `Riding` is not used; use survival instead, as specified in Genesys rulebook.
-   Discard Genesys Magic skills
-   Use Star Wars Combat skills
    -   `Brawl`
    -   `Gunnery`
    -   `Melee`
    -   `Ranged (Light)`
    -   `Ranged (Heavy)`

    -   `Warfare`
    -   `Xenology`

## Talents

-   By default, the following talents, but the depreciated one, are allowed: [Talents](/rules/talents/)

### Signature abilities

-   A character must have two rank 5 talents to purchase a signature ability for his character.
-   The signature abilities are considered tier 6 talents.
-   They cost 30xp to purchase.
-   Optionnally, there is no limitation to how many signature abilities a character can have.
-   Once acquired, use the Star Wars signature ability trees as is.

> That guy had something very similar to what I wrote about signature abilities, so I picked up some of his ideas to complete my version (which is almost the same thing now); Thanks to his work on [Star Wars to Genesys Special Rule Conversion](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1CD92_GacFtUMmlaFXQaBbvACcKz4eX_k).

### The force

Use Star Wars Force Power trees as is.

## Specialization

Since there is no specialization in Genesys the players have a few choices:

1.  Choose a Genesys career and apply the rules as is.
1.  Choose a Star Wars career, check the 8 career skills and gain 1 rank in 4 of those skills (as per both rulesets).
1.  Choose a Star Wars specialization, choose and check 8 of the 12 career skills and gain 1 rank in 4 of those.
1.  Create a new career that better fits your needs, with your GM.

<!--
To account for the increased number of skills (knowledge) and the epicness of Star Wars heroes and villains, at character creation:

-   If a player find a specialization that suits him, apply the 4 new career skills and increase two of those by 1 as per the Star Wars rules.
-   If a player does not find a specialization, allow him to create one and give that player:
    -   2 more career skills
        -   GM and player must agree on the skills
    -   2 skill points to add to career skills. At least one must increase the two new career skills.
        -   As per normal rules, no single skill can start with more than two ranks.
