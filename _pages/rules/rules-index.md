## Campaign Theme

Star Wars Imperial Security Bureau Agents: New Order fanatics!

The story begins right after the Empire Strikes Back.

## Core rules

Genesys

## Star Wars specific mechanics

Age of Rebellion's duty system (p. 49, 325).

## Skills

-   Use Genesys general skills
    -   `Alchemy`: not used
    -   `Driving` (same as `Piloting (planetary)`)
    -   `Operating` = piloting capital ship
    -   `Piloting` = (same as `Piloting (space)`)
    -   `Riding` = not used, use survival instead; as specified in Genesys rulebook.
-   Discard Genesys Magic skills
-   Use Star Wars Combat skills
-   Use Star Wars Knowledge skills

## Talents

-   By default, the following talents, but the depreciated one, are allowed: [Talents](/rules/talents/)
    -   If a talent does not feel right for Star Wars, the GM can always forbid its use. This is especially true for `Realms of Terrinoth (ROT)` talents that could be more fantasy-oriented than Star Wars-y.
-   Signature abilities
    -   A character must have two rank 5 talents to purchase a signature ability for his character.
    -   The signature abilities are considered tier 6 talents.
    -   They cost 30xp to purchase.
    -   Optionnally, there is no limitation to how many signature abilities a character can have.
    -   Once acquired, use the Star Wars signature ability trees as is.
-   Use Star Wars Force Power trees as is.

> That guy had something very similar to what I wrote about signature abilities, so I picked up some of his ideas to complete my version (which is almost the same thing now); Thanks to his work on [Star Wars to Genesys Special Rule Conversion](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1CD92_GacFtUMmlaFXQaBbvACcKz4eX_k).

## Specialization

To account for the increased number of skills (knowledge) and the epicness of Star Wars heroes and villains, at character creation:

-   If a player find a specialization that suits him, apply the 4 new career skills and increase two of those by 1 as per the Star Wars rules.
-   If a player does not find a specialization, allow him to create one and give that player:
    -   2 more career skills
        -   GM and player must agree on the skills
    -   2 skill points to add to career skills. At least one must increase the two new career skills.
        -   As per normal rules, no single skill can start with more than two ranks.
