Following are the rules, or compilation of rules, that will be used in my Star Wars/Genesys campaign **For the New Order**.

## Campaign Theme

Star Wars Imperial Security Bureau Agents: New Order fanatics!

The story begins right after the Empire Strikes Back.

The game will run as fast as possible, based on the story flow and player choices, with high XP rewards for fast evolution/climax.

## Core rules

Genesys

## Star Wars specific mechanics

Use Age of Rebellion's duty system.

## Skills

-   Use Genesys general skills
    -   `Alchemy`: not used
    -   `Driving` (same as `Piloting (planetary)`)
    -   `Operating` = piloting capital ship
    -   `Piloting` = `Piloting (space)`
    -   `Riding` = <mark>Keep or Discard?</mark> Could be survival instead; as specified in Genesys rulebook.
-   Discard Genesys Magic skills
-   Use Star Wars Combat skills
-   Use Star Wars Knowledge skills

## Talents

-   Use Star Wars Force Power trees (see FoD)
-   Signature abilities
    -   A character must have one rank 5 talent to attach a signature ability.
        -   To be harder, it could be two rank 5 talents instead.
        -   Players and GM should agree beforehand.
    -   Use the Star Wars signature ability trees as is

## Specialization

To account for the increased number of skills, at character creation:

-   If a player find a specialization that suits him, apply the 4 new career skills and increase two of those by 1 as per the Star Wars rules.
-   If a player does not find a specialization, allow him to create (name) one and give that player:
    -   2 more career skills
        -   GM and player must agree on the skills
    -   2 skill points to add to career skills. At least one must increase the two new career skills.

## Star Wars Traits

-   If there are missing traits in Genesys that are available in SW EotE, AoR or FoD, they can be ported over with a consensus of the players and the GM about rank, prerequisites, etc.
-   By default, if a trait is available in both games, Genesys has priority
-   If for some reason, the SW version feels more SW-y, consensus could be made to use that version instead or a hybrid house version of both.
-   Nothing is set in stone; we could revert, change or update prior rules if the needs arise.

## House rules

-   [Troops deployment](/rules/imperial-troops-deployment-rules/)
