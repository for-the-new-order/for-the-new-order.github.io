Following are the rules, or compilation of rules, that will be used in my Star Wars/Genesys campaign **For the New Order**.

## Campaign Theme

Star Wars Imperial Security Bureau Agents: New Order fanatics!

The story begins right after the Empire Strikes Back.

The game will run as fast as possible, based on the story flow and player choices, with high XP rewards for fast evolution/climax.

## Core rules

Genesys

## Star Wars specific mechanics

-   Use Age of Rebellion's duty system (p. 49, 325).
-   Use Age of Rebellion's Onslaught at Arda I module's mass combat system (p. 30).

## Skills

-   Use Genesys general skills
    -   `Alchemy`: not used
    -   `Driving` (same as `Piloting (planetary)`)
    -   `Operating` = piloting capital ship
    -   `Piloting` = `Piloting (space)`
    -   `Riding` = <mark>Keep or Discard?</mark> Could be survival instead; as specified in Genesys rulebook.
-   Discard Genesys Magic skills
-   Use Star Wars Combat skills
-   Use Star Wars Knowledge skills

## Talents

-   By default, the following talents, but the depreciated one, are allowed: [Talents](/rules/talents/)
    -   If a talent does not feel right for Star Wars, the GM can always forbid its use. This is especially true for `Realms of Terrinoth (ROT)` talents that could be more fantasy-oriented than Star Wars-y.
-   Signature abilities
    -   A character must have two rank 5 talents to purchase a signature ability for his character.
    -   The signature abilities are considered tier 6 talents.
    -   They cost 30xp to purchase.
    -   Optionnally, there is no limitation to how many signature abilities a character can have.
    -   Once acquired, use the Star Wars signature ability trees as is.
-   Use Star Wars Force Power trees as is.

> This guy had something very similar to what I wrote about signature abilities, so I picked up some of his ideas to complete my version (which is almost the same thing now); Thanks to his work on [Star Wars to Genesys Special Rule Conversion](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1CD92_GacFtUMmlaFXQaBbvACcKz4eX_k).

**Notes on conversions:**

-   If there are missing talents, they can be ported over (or created) with a consensus of the players and the GM about rank, prerequisites, etc.
-   By default, if a trait is available in both games, Genesys has priority
-   If for some reason, the SW version feels more SW-y, consensus could be made to use that version instead or a hybrid house version of both.
-   Nothing is set in stone; we could revert, change or update prior rules if the needs arise.

## Specialization

To account for the increased number of skills, at character creation:

-   If a player find a specialization that suits him, apply the 4 new career skills and increase two of those by 1 as per the Star Wars rules.
-   If a player does not find a specialization, allow him to create (name) one and give that player:
    -   2 more career skills
        -   GM and player must agree on the skills
    -   2 skill points to add to career skills. At least one must increase the two new career skills.

## House rules

-   [Troops deployment](/rules/imperial-troops-deployment-rules/)
