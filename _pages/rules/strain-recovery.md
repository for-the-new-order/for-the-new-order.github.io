After each combat, players can recover some strain (see p. 116 CRB).

Depending of the fight, the GM could choose to use the following optional rules:

- {% include text-with-symbols.html content="Each [SU] helps recover 1 strain" %}
- {% include text-with-symbols.html content="Each [AD][AD] helps recover 1 strain" %}
- {% include text-with-symbols.html content="Each [TR] helps recover 2 strain" %}
