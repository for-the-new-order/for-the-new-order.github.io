## Ranks & Rewards

_See below to the full ranks list and their badges [Badges](#badges)._

To rank up, the players needs to accumulate contribution ranks (see Age of Rebellionâ€™s duty system [p. 49, 325] for more info).
The following table gives the GMs a guide about how many Contribution Ranks (CR) are needed to achieve a certain ranks. GM discretion is advised, especially for higher ranks.

Below are also some guidelines about the kind of rewards a PC could want, based on his CR.

-   <sup>1</sup> The XP related to NPCs are simple guides; a player or a GM could choose a NPC from a book and modify it a bit. Everything is at the discretion of the GM. The GM should consider that the higher CR, the stronger the NPC.
-   <sup>\*</sup>All starship comes in fully crewed and equipped with standard equipment.
