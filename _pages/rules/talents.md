## Imperial campaign
By default, the following talents, but the depreciated one, are allowed.

If a talent does not feel right for Star Wars, the GM can always forbid its use. This is especially true for `Realms of Terrinoth (ROT)` talents that could be more fantasy-oriented than Star Wars-y.

## Genesys Talents Expanded

Genesys Talents Expanded is a community effort to bring a wider selection of talents to the Genesys Role-playing System, published by Fantasy Flight Games, to provide GMâ€™s and players more options for constructing their campaigns and characters.

The bulk of these talents are from Fantasy Flight Games publications,mostly from the Star Wars Roleplaying games; Edge of the Empire, Age of Rebellion, and Force and Destiny.

Talents from the Star Wars games, which do not fit the nature and/or standards of Genesys, were modified and/or renamed, or omitted altogether.

Additional talents, at the end of the collection, were created and vetted by the Genesys gaming community.
