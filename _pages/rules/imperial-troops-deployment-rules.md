As Imperial Agents, players have access to all kind of imperial perks!

We could divide these perks into two categories: 1. Human resources 2. Material resources

Some resources are easier than others to access… In this document, we will focus on the "human resources" aspect and how the PCs can control imperial troops during their adventures.

## Military operations

Sometimes, the PCs might want to do some more impressive stuff than assigning 2 Stormtroopers to guard a door, like calling a Star Destroyer to blockade the escape of some Rebel operatives. I will call those most impressive display of power: military operations.

To start a military operation, the players must:

1.  Flip a Story Point
2.  Then roll a _Team Presence_ skill test against a difficulty set by the GM
    -   The difficulty is based on the number of resources and the risks involved in the operation.

If the player succeeds, the military operation starts, troops follow PCs orders, etc.
If they fail, well the officer in charge had something else to do, find the idea ridiculous or something else that makes sense for the current situation.

_Team Presence_ is a team skill, so if the check fails, another PC cannot try again right away. The GM discretion is advised here.

## Team Presence

The Team Presence skill represents the social skills of the group. In game terms, it is based on their projected authority, credibility and reputation and how other Imperials respond to it.

To encourage diversity in the group, all players pick one social skill to represent their contribution to the Presence pool.

Social skills: Charm, Coercion, Deception, Leadership, Negotiation

The team presence rating is divided into two parts: the skill and the attribute ratings, which end up like building any other dice pool. Note that there is no need to keep track of both the skill and the attribute ratings separately, only keeping track of the "Team Presence dice pool" should be fine.

-   The skill rating is equal to the average of the chosen social skills ranks of all players attending the game session.
-   The attribute rating is equal to the average of the chosen social skills' attributes of all players attending the game session.

So yes, the Team Presence dice pool may vary from game session to game session.

_To avoid recalculating the Team Presence rating for every encounter, you should use the default linked attribute; otherwise, feel free to link whatever attribute you see fits best, as per the Genesys system optional rule._

**Example:**

Based on the following party:

-   Player 1 choose Charm (Presence) and has a rating of 2 (2)
-   Player 2 choose Coercion (Willpower) and has a rating of 1 (2)
-   Player 3 choose Deception (Cunning) and has a rating of 1 (2)
-   Player 4 choose Leadership (Presence) and has a rating of 2 (3)

The calculation goes as follow:

-   The sum of all skill ranks is 6 (2+1+1+2)
-   The sum of attributes ranks is 9 (2+2+2+3)
-   The number of players is 4
-   The average skill rank is 1 (6/4=1.5 rounded down = 1)
-   The average attribute rank is 2 (9/4=2.25 rounded down = 2)
-   The dice pool is then 2 + 1 upgrades for a final dice pool of {% include text-with-symbols.html content="[AB][PR]" %}.

**Another example:**

Based on the following party:

-   Player 1 choose Charm (Presence) and has a rating of 4 (2)
-   Player 2 choose Coercion (Willpower) and has a rating of 4 (3)
-   Player 3 choose Deception (Cunning) and has a rating of 3 (3)
-   Player 4 choose Leadership (Presence) and has a rating of 5 (4)

The calculation goes as follow:

-   The sum of all skill ranks is 4+4+3+5=16
-   The sum of attributes ranks is 2+3+3+4=12
-   The number of players is 4
-   The average skill rank is 16/4=4
-   The average attribute rank is 12/4=3
-   The dice pool is then 4 + 3 upgrades for a final dice pool of {% include text-with-symbols.html content="[AB][PR][PR][PR]" %}

## Who does not want free troops?

The most obvious use of Imperial resources would be troops! As Imperial Agents, on most Imperial worlds, the PCs can easily order any Stormtroopers to execute some simple actions like to guard a door or call in a Tie fighter escort for their shuttle without requiring anybody's permission. The PCs should not hinder any bigger plans by doing this though.

## Military operations difficulty

The following table is only a guideline and must be treated as so. It is in no way a strict way of assembling the difficulty dice pool of a specific task.

## Team Contribution Ranks

Based on the Duty system of AoR, the team Contribution Rank increase as a group. Even players playing imperial agents should focus on teamplay; the team want the New Order to succeed and will do anything in their power to see that happen (collectively)!

The following table describes the benefits of each rank. The perks in that table do not require any roll (unless the GM decide otherwise). But, aiming for higher gear or resources than your rank allows usually do.

## Adjustments

As with everything else, situation and location tend to change the difficulty of a task.

### Team Contribution Rank Bonuses

The higher the contribution rank of a character, the easier it is to get obeyed by troops and officers alike. At some point, you have done so much that you became well known and respected (or feared) throughout the Empire (and the rebels).

### Milieu

Depending on the milieu, having backup could be easier or harder.

**Example:** getting a squad of Stormtroopers to guard some doors on a remote planet can be tricky if the place is already understaffed!

Mission type
Based on the mission assigned to the PCs, it could run from forbidden to highly recommended to call for help.

Example: during the infiltration of a rebel base, calling Stormtroopers for help is impossible; there is no Stormtrooper on the base; it is a Rebel base!

### Spare some change?

Both the GM and the PCs can trade {% include text-with-symbols.html content="[BO][BO][BO][BO] or [SE][SE][SE][SE]" %} for an upgrade or a downgrade.

## The GM factor

<small><em>(based on the GM schemes)</em></small>

Depending on the circumstances, the GM can allow players to use a lot of resources if it makes sense for the specific scene or narrative or forbid the use of resources. These rules are to create an imperial feel to the game, not to disrupt it.

## The Setbacks

Of course, using the Imperial Armada sounds easy and fun, but getting too many troops killed for nothing or failing a massive scale operation will not be quickly forgotten by the Imperial Authority affected and might end up with severe sanctions!

**Example:** crashing a Star Destroyer on a planet just for fun will most likely cost somebody his life (or force the team to start a new career as Rebel Scums)!

## Team Presence Talents

To get better results, PCs can invest their contribution rank rewards into _Team Presence Talents_. These special talents are applied to the _Team Presence_ skill and affect its effectiveness. Each player buys _Team Presence Talents_ individually.

The concept is the same as the characters' talents: you must have more lower level ranks than the rank you want to purchase (see Genesys talents rules for more info).
The higher rank is 3.

As an example, one player could specialize in the army, while another PC could focus on the navy.

### Buying Team Presence Talents

When acquiring a new Contribution Rank, a player can decide to buy a Team Presence Talent (TPT) instead of choosing a reward (see Alliance Rewards p. 50 AoR).

<mark>The variance used in the campaign is still TBD</mark>

#### Slower (normal) reward variance

Each TPT's rank cost 1 contribution rank reward.
Ex.: rank 1 cost 1, rank 2 cost 2 and rank 3 cost 3.

Assuming that the PC spent all his points in the Team Presence Talent system, this ruleset will allow a contribution rank 16 to have:

-   2 rank 3 talents
-   3 rank 2 talents
-   4 rank 1 talents

#### Fast reward variance

Talents of rank 1 and 2 cost 1 contribution rank reward while rank 3 talents cost 2
Ex.: rank 1 cost 1, rank 2 cost 1 and rank 3 cost 2.

Assuming that the PC spent all his points in the Team Presence Talent system, this ruleset will allow a contribution rank 11 to have:

-   2 rank 3 talents
-   3 rank 2 talents
-   4 rank 1 talents

#### Super-fast reward variance

Any talent cost 1 contribution rank reward.
Ex.: rank 1 cost 1, rank 2 cost 1 and rank 3 cost 1. But you must have two level one before buying a level two anyway…

Assuming that the PC spent all his points in the Team Presence Talent system, this ruleset will allow a contribution rank 9 to have:

-   2 rank 3 talents
-   3 rank 2 talents
-   4 rank 1 talents
