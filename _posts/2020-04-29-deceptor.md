The most recent addition to the PCs arsenal is the Victory Class Star Destroyer Deceptor.

In addition to its standard load, it contains a lab specialized in drug research.
More specifically aiming at drugs to torture people.
No need to introduce the instigator of such a project: Lieutenant Commander Kaine.

It's flight officer is Senior Captain Felecia Kralick, a condescending, proud, and very analytical officer, that got reknown for her fierce leadership and tactics at the blockade of Naarmatis.
Captain Linoel Tatcher is the army officer in charge, he is vain, but adaptable.
