I just released a balance update for the Squads & Squadrons reward talents trees.
The update also addresses some missing prerequisites.

Here is an overview of changes:

-   Update `Voluntary [unit] Sacrifice` talents
-   Change tiers of `Formation: Dug In` and `Formation: Close` talents from 1, 2, 3 to 1, 3, 5.
-   Change tiers of `Formation: Search Party` talents from 1, 1, 1 to 1, 3, 5.
-   Change `Unthreatable [unit] [Squad|Squadron]` from tier 1 to tier 2
-   Change `Fearless [unit] [Squad|Squadron]` from tier 2 to tier 3
-   Change `Undespairable [unit] [Squad|Squadron]` from tier 2 to tier 4
-   Review `Running Dark` talents (name, tier, effects, prerequisites)
-   Review `[unit] Formation Master`

> `[unit]` stands for the type of unit, like Navy, Army, or Stormtrooper.
>
> `[Squad|Squadron]` stands for `Squad` or `Squadron`.
