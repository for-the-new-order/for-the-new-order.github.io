I added a new section, named [Highlights](/game-content/highlights/), that contains a collection of elements that do not fit anywhere else:

- Important **Events** that happened
- **Organizations** that were encountered
- New **Races** that was introduced
- **Storylines** that are active or completed
- Encountered (rebels) **Squadrons**

Many of the descriptions are simple and were written when I worked on the adventure reports, but like everything else, I'll do my best to add and update the content.
