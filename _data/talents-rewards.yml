            The character can use minions as an extension of himself, boosting his combat skills. This talent should be very useful at speeding up encounters with many NPCs, while using the number provided by the Empire.

            To activate Squadron Leader I, the character must make an easy (?) Leadership check as an incidental to take control of a minion group that is part of the Imperial Navy. 
            If he succeeds, Squadron Leader I is active until the end of the encounter.
            If he fails, he cannot activate Squadron Leader I IV or above until the end of the encounter.

            When Squadron Leader I is active, once per turn, the character can upgrade a skill check a number time equal to the number of minion that he controls, up to a maximum of 1.
            The minions must possess the skill (group only) that the character wants to improve.

            For example, a character with Squadron Leader I, an attribute of 4, a skill of 5, that controls 1 minion, would roll [PR][PR][PR][PR][PR] (skill: [PR][PR][PR][PR][AB], upgraded once).

            Your squaddies are reacting so well to your commands that they seem to avoid certain death from time to time...

            During combat, the character can spend [AD] to heal his wingman.
            Each [AD] heals 1 point of damage from a wingman, up to a maximum of his hull threshold. You cannot "respawn" a wingman using [AD].
            For example, if you control 2 minions with 6 hull threshold each (for a total of 12), and they have taken 10 damage, you could use up to [AD][AD][AD][AD] to heal the last minion to his maximum, leading to a hull threshold of 6/12. Healing more than 4 would mean that a "dead wingman" would come back from the grave.

            You can also use a [TR] to "respawn" a defeated wingman; it must be narratively possible.
            For example, if you control 2 minions with 6 hull threshold each (for a total of 12), and they have taken 10 damage, using a [TR] would allow you to add 6 to the pool, "spawning" a new starfighter; leading to a hull threshold of 4/12.
