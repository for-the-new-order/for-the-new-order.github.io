            "Faster than the standard Star Destroyer, the Assimilator, as its classification would suggest, is typically going to be found apart of a taskforce conducting patrols of large expanses of Space, or apart of a rapid response taskforce that works to prevent the retreat of hostiles.",
            "Main purposes: Patrol and Interdiction.",
            "The Assimilator only possesses two fighter squadrons, thus leaving it the wrong type of ship to patrol solo. Its small complement is the reason why it is apart of taskforces, rather than solo missions.",
            "A flaw was pointed out that the ship was incapable of immediately leaping into a charted Hyperspace Jump after turning off its Gravity Well Projectors, requiring almost two minutes of a cooldown before allowing the jump to complete, should the ship be under fire while holding that gravity field, it'd leave the ship vulnerable before making its hopeful escape."

Lightly armed and armored, it shares the dagger-shaped hull and large crew of its larger siblings, and operates as both a picket and reconnaissance vessel as well as an escort ship for larger, cruiser-sized ships",
            "Thanks to their size and role, these vessels rarely serve in the line of battle with larger types of Star Destroyers. Instead, they patrol trade routes, serve as battlegroup leaders for small, backwater fleets, and operate as lone cruisers among the fringes of the Inner and Outer Rim, battling pirates and smugglers and rooting out Alliance agents."
