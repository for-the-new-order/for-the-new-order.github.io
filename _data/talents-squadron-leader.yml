  Ranked: 'No'

      To purchase this talent, the character must have be Rank 3 and have Leadership 1. Only a limited places are available for this course, so getting a spot cost 1 Contribution Rank.

      The character can use minions as an extension of himself, boosting his combat skills. This talent should be very useful at speeding up encounters with many NPCs, while using the number provided by the Empire.

      To activate Squadron Leader I, the character must make an easy (?) Leadership check as an incidental to take control of a minion group that is part of the Imperial Navy. 
      If he succeeds, Squadron Leader I is active until the end of the encounter.
      If he fails, he cannot activate Squadron Leader I IV or above until the end of the encounter.

      When Squadron Leader I is active, once per turn, the character can upgrade a skill check a number time equal to the number of minion that he controls, up to a maximum of 1.
      The minions must possess the skill (group only) that the character wants to improve.

      For example, a character with Squadron Leader I, an attribute of 4, a skill of 5, that controls 1 minion, would roll [PR][PR][PR][PR][PR] (skill: [PR][PR][PR][PR][AB], upgraded once).
