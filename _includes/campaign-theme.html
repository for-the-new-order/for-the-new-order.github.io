## Campaign Theme

Star Wars Imperial Security Bureau Agents: New Order fanatics!

The story begins right after the Empire Strikes Back.

The PCs are members of a special division: the "CSO" (Cross-Cutting Shadow Overseers).
That gives them the opportunity to execute missions in all ISB branches (Internal Affairs, Re-Education, Enforcement, etc.) and not to be limited to one. 
Only elite members of the COMPORN can dream of being a member of that division, and only the best will survive it.
